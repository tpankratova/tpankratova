### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Throughout my career, I have gained experience in data analysis, project management, and team leadership.

For over 5 years, I studied consumer behavior in retail chains, focusing on successful project implementation, team development, and strategic initiatives.

Recently, I graduated from the Data Analyst course at Yandex.Practicum to strengthen my knowledge of data analysis.

Now, I am open to new professional challenges.
