### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Throughout my career, I have gained experience in data analysis, project management, and team leadership.

For over 5 years, I have learned consumer behavior in retail chains, where my efforts were focused on successful project implementation, team development, and strategic initiatives.

Recently, I graduated Data Analyst course at Yandex.Practicum to make my knowledge of data analysis stronger.

Now, I am open to new professional challenges.
